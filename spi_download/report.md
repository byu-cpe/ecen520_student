## Assignment Specific Responses
  1. Synthesis Step Review
    * How many times did you synthesize your design? **X**
    * Complete the synthesis resource utilization table listed [below](#synthesis-resource-utilization-table) from your synthesis report.
    * How many state machines were inferred for your top-level design? (review the synthesis report) **X**
    * Did you have any synthesis warnings or errors in your final synthesis run? **None/Some** (if some, summarize them here)
  2. Timing Report Review
    * What is the "Worst Negative Slack" (WNS) of this design?: **X.Xns**
    * How many "THS Total Endpoints" are there for this design? **X**
    * What is the "Source" netname of the "Max Delay Paths" worst case net? **<netname>>**
    * What is the "Destination" netname of the "Max Delay Paths" worst case net? **<netname>>**
    * What is the "Source" netname of the "Min Delay Paths" worst case net? **<netname>>**
    * What is the "Destination" netname of the "Min Delay Paths" worst case net? **<netname>>**
    * Summarize the `no_input_delay` and `no_output_delay` section of the report: (i.e., list number of ports in each of the sections and any other observations)
  3. Complete the Utilization Report table listed [below](#utilization-report-table) from your implementation utilization report.
  4. How many times did you have to download your design to the Nexys4 board before it worked correctly? **X**
