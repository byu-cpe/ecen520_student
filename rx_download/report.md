## Summarize any major challenges you had completing this assignment
* Challenge 1 (Submit at least one challenge for your assignment report)
* Challenge 2 (If you don't have a second challenge, remove this bullet)

## Provide suggestions for improving this assignment (optional)
  * Suggestion 1 (List 'None' for the bullet item if you are not providing suggestions)

## Assignment Specific Responses
  1. Fill in the State Machine Encoding table listed [below](#state-machine-encoding)
  2. Fill in the Resource Utilization table listed [below](#resource-utilization-table)
  3. Indicate the "Worst Negative Slack" of your design. This is found in the timing report and indicates how much timing you slack you have with the current clocking (we will discuss this later in the semester): **X.Xns**
  4. Indicate how many times you had to synthesize your design:
  5. Indicate how many times you had to download your bitstream before your circuit worked. Note that I want two numbers: number of synthesis attempts (X) and number of download attempts (Y). Do not mix these together. **X/Y**

? How many state machines were inferred for your top-level design? (review the synthesis report)

### State Machine Encoding

| State | Encoding |
| ---- | ---- |
| IDLE   | '00000' |

### Resource Utilization Table

| Resource | Utilization |
| ---- | ---- |
| BUFG   |  |
| CARRY4 |  |
| LUTx   |  |
| FDRE   |  |
| IBUF   |  |
| OBUF   |  |

(For LUTx, add up the total number of LUTs of all sizes)
