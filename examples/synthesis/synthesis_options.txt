                                control set optimization will be performed 
                                and fewer control sets will result. To 
                                disable control set optimization completely, 
                                set to 0.

Description:

  Directly launches the Vivado synthesis engine to compile and synthesize a
  design in either Project Mode or Non-Project Mode in the Vivado Design
  Suite. Refer to the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Design Flows Overview
  (UG892) for a complete description of Project Mode and Non-Project Mode.

  Vivado synthesis can be launched directly with the synth_design command in
  the Non-Project Mode of the Vivado Design Suite.

  Tip: The synth_design can be multi-threaded to speed the process. Refer to
  the set_param command for more information on setting the
  general.maxThreads parameter.

  In Project Mode, synthesis should be launched from an existing synthesis
  run created with the create_run command. The run is launched using the
  launch_runs command, and this in turn calls synth_design for Vivado
  synthesis.

  You can also use the synth_design command to elaborate RTL source files,
  and open an elaborated design:

    synth_design -rtl -name rtl_1

  This command returns a transcript of the synthesis process, or returns an
  error if it fails.

Arguments:

  -name <arg> - (Optional) This is the name assigned to the synthesized
  design when it is opened by the Vivado tool after synthesis has completed.
  This name is for reference purposes, and has nothing to do with the
  top-level of the design or any logic contained within.

  -part <arg> - (Optional) The target AMD device to use for the design. If
  the part is not specified the default part assigned to the project will be
  used.

  -constrset <arg> - (Optional) The name of the XDC constraints to use when
  synthesizing the design. Vivado synthesis requires the use of XDC, and does
  not support UCF. The -constrset argument must refer to a constraint fileset
  that exists. It cannot be used to create a new fileset. Use the
  create_fileset command for that purpose.

  -top <arg> - (Optional) The top module of the design hierarchy.

  Important: If you use the find_top command to define the -top option, be
  sure to specify only one top if find_top returns multiple prospects. See
  the examples below.

  -include_dirs <args> - (Optional) The directories to search for Verilog
  `include files. You can specify multiple directories by creating a list to
  contain them:

    -include_dirs {C:/data/include1 C:/data/include2}

  -generic <name>=<value> - (Optional) The value of a VHDL generic entity, or
  of a Verilog parameter. The -generic option can be used to override the
  assigned values of parameters in the RTL design sources. However it can
  only override parameters at the top level of the design. The parameters of
  lower-level modules can only be overridden at the time of instantiation and
  not by the -generic option. The syntax for the -generic argument is
  <name>=<value>, specifying the name of the generic or parameter, and the
  value to be assigned. Repeat the -generic option multiple times in the
  synth_design command for each generic or parameter value to be defined:

    synth_design -generic width=32 -generic depth=512 ...

  Important: When specifying binary values for boolean or std_logic VHDL
  generic types, you must specify the value using the Verilog bit format,
  rather than standard VHDL format:

    0 = 1`b0
    01010000 = 8`b01010000

  -verilog_define <name>=<text> - (Optional) Set values for Verilog `define,
  and `ifdef, statements. The syntax for the -verilog_define argument is
  <name>=<text>, specifying the name of the define directive, and the value
  to be assigned. The argument can be reused multiple times in a single
  synth_design command.

    synth_design -verilog_define <name>=<value> -verilog_define <name>=<value> ...

  -flatten_hierarchy <arg> - (Optional) Flatten the hierarchy of the design
  during LUT mapping. The valid values are:

   *  rebuilt - This will attempt to rebuild the original hierarchy of the
      RTL design after synthesis has completed. This is the default setting.

   *  full - Flatten the hierarchy of the design.

   *  none - Do not flatten the hierarchy of the design. This will preserve
      the hierarchy of the design, but will also limit the design
      optimization that can be performed by the synthesis tool.

  -gated_clock_conversion <arg> - (Optional) Convert clock gating logic to
  use the flop enable pins when available. This optimization can eliminate
  logic and simplify the netlist. Refer to the GATED_CLOCK property in the
  Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Synthesis (UG901) for more information.
  Valid values for this option are:

   *  off - Disables the conversion of clock gating logic during synthesis,
      regardless of the use of the GATED_CLOCK property in the RTL design.

   *  on - Converts clock gating logic based on the use of the GATED_CLOCK
      property in the RTL design.

   *  auto - lets Vivado synthesis perform gated clock conversion if either
      the GATED_CLOCK property is present in the RTL, or if the Vivado tool
      detects a gate with a valid clock constraint.

  -directive <arg> - (Optional) Direct synthesis to achieve specific design
  objectives. Only one directive can be specified for a single synth_design
  command, and values are case-sensitive. Valid values are:

   *  default - Run the default synthesis process.

   *  runtimeoptimized - Perform fewer timing optimizations and eliminate
      some RTL optimizations to reduce synthesis run time.

   *  AreaOptimized_high - Perform general area optimizations including
      AreaMapLargeShiftRegToBRAM, AreaThresholdUseDSP directives.

   *  AreaOptimized_medium - Perform general area optimizations including
      forcing ternary adder implementation, applying new thresholds for use
      of carry chain in comparators, and implementing area optimized
      multiplexers.

   *  AlternateRoutability - Algorithms to improve routability with reduced
      use of MUXFs and CARRYs.

   *  AreaMapLargeShiftRegToBRAM - Detects large shift registers and
      implements them using dedicated blocks of RAM.

   *  AreaMultThresholdDSP - Lower threshold for dedicated DSP block
      inference for packing multipliers.

   *  FewerCarryChains - Higher operand size threshold to use LUTs instead of
      the carry chain.

   *  PerformanceOptimized - Perform general timing optimizations including
      logic level reduction at the expense of area.

   *  LogicCompaction - Configure LUTs and Carry chains for multipliers in a
      way that makes it easier for the placer to pack these structures into
      small areas.

  -rtl - (Optional) Elaborate the HDL source files and open the RTL design.
  In designs that use out-of-context (OOC) modules, such as IP from the
  Xilinx IP catalog, the Vivado Design Suite will import synthesized design
  checkpoints (DCP) for the OOC modules in the design, and import associated
  constraint files (XDC) into the elaborated design. However, you can disable
  the default behavior using the -rtl_skip_ip and -rtl_skip_constraints
  options.

  -lint - Run RTL Linter on source files against various rules. The following
  are the supported rules.

   *  ASSIGN-1(arithmetic overlfow)

   *  ASSIGN-2(mixed operand signedness)

   *  ASSIGN-3(shift overflow)

   *  ASSIGN-4(unused scalar)

   *  ASSIGN-5(bit in array not set)

   *  ASSIGN-6(bit in array not used)

   *  ASSIGN-7(mult-assign/multi-driver)

   *  QOR-1(arithmetic operator not mergeable)

   *  INFER-1(inferred latch)

   *  INFER-2(incomplete case statement)

   *  INFER-3(case equality)

   *  CLOCK-1(module using both clock edges)

   *  RESET-1(mixed asyncreset)

   *  RESET-2(missing async reset logic)

  Create_waiver -type LINT can be used to waive rules or individual linter
  warnings. For example,

    create_waiver -type LINT -id ASSIGN-3 -description {waive all warnings from ASSIGN-3 check}

  -rtl_skip_ip - (Optional) This option requires the use of the -rtl option.
  When elaborating the RTL design, this option causes the Vivado Design Suite
  to skip loading the DCP files for OOC modules in the design, and instead
  load a stub file to treat the OOC modules as black boxes. This can
  significantly speed elaboration of the design.

  Tip: An OOC synthesis run will be needed in either case to generate the DCP
  file that is loaded during elaboration, or to generate the stub file needed
  for the black box.

  -rtl_skip_constraints - (Optional) This option requires the use of the -rtl
  option. When elaborating the RTL design, this option causes the Vivado
  Design Suite to skip loading any design constraints (XDC) into the
  elaborated design. This can significantly speed elaboration of the design.

  -bufg <arg> - (Optional) Specify the maximum number of global clock buffers
  to be used on clock nets during synthesis. Specified as a value >= 1, which
  should not exceed the BUFG count on the target device. The default value is
  12.

  Tip: Vivado synthesis infers up to the number of BUFGs specified, including
  those instantiated in the RTL source. For example, with the default setting
  of -bufg 12, if there are three BUFGs instantiated in the RTL, the tool
  infers up to nine more for a total of 12.

  -no_lc - (Optional) Disable the default LUT combining feature of Vivado
  synthesis.

  -shreg_min_size <arg> - (Optional) Specified as an integer, this is the
  minimum length for a chain of registers to be mapped onto SRL. The default
  is three.

  -mode [ default | out_of_context ] - (Optional) Out of Context mode
  specifies the synthesis of an IP module, or block module, for use in an
  out-of-context design flow. This mode turns off I/O buffer insertion for
  the module, and marks the module as OOC, to facilitate its use in the tool
  flow. The block can also be implemented for analysis purposes. Refer to the
  Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Designing with IP (UG896) or the Vivado
  Design Suite User Guide: Hierarchical Design (UG905) for more information.

  -fsm_extraction <arg> - (Optional) Finite state machine (FSM) encoding is
  automatic (auto) in Vivado synthesis by default. This option enables state
  machine identification and specifies the type of encoding that should be
  applied. Valid values are: off, one_hot, sequential, johnson, gray, auto.
  Automatic encoding (auto) allows the tool to choose the best encoding for
  each state machine identified. In this case, the tool may use different
  encoding styles for different FSMs in the same design.

  Note: Use -fsm_extraction off to disable finite state machine extraction in
  Vivado synthesis. This will override the FSM_ENCODING property when
  specified.

  -keep_equivalent_registers - (Optional) Works like the KEEP property to
  prevent the merging of registers during optimization.

  -resource_sharing <arg> - (Optional) Share arithmetic operators like adders
  or subtractors between different signals, rather than creating new
  operators. This can result in better area usage when it is turned on. Valid
  values are: auto, on, off. The default is auto.

  -cascade_dsp [ auto | tree | force ] - (Optional) Specifies how to
  implement adders that add DSP block outputs. Valid values include auto,
  tree, force. The default setting is auto.

  -control_set_opt_threshold <arg> - (Optional) Threshold for synchronous
  control set optimization to decrease the number of control sets. Specifies
  how large the fanout of a control set should be before it starts using it
  as a control set. For example, if -control_set_opt_threshold is set to 10,
  a synchronous reset that only fans out to 5 registers would be moved to the
  D input logic, rather than using the reset line of a register. However, if
  -control_set_opt_threshold is set to 4, then the reset line is used. This
  option can be specified as "auto", or as an integer from 0 to 16. The
  default setting is "auto", and the actual threshold used under "auto" can
  vary depending on the selected device architecture.

  -incremental - (Optional) Specify a DCP file for the incremental
  compilation flow. In the incremental synthesis flow, the netlist from the
  incremental DCP is applied to the design objects in the current design to
  reuse existing synthesis results when possible.

  -max_bram <arg> - (Optional) Specify the maximum number of Block RAM to add
  to the design during synthesis. Specify a value >= 1, which should not
  exceed the available Block RAM count on the target device. If a value of -1
  is used, the Vivado synthesis tool will not exceed the available Block RAM
  limit of the device. The default value is -1.

  Note: A value of 0 directs Vivado synthesis to not infer Block RAMs in the
  design, but is not a recommended value.

  -max_uram <arg> - (Optional) Specify the maximum number of Ultra RAM blocks
  (URAM) to add to the design during synthesis. Specify a value >= 1, which
  should not exceed the available URAM count on the target device. If a value
  of -1 is used, the Vivado synthesis tool will not exceed the available URAM
  block limit of the device. The default value is -1.

  Note: A value of 0 directs Vivado synthesis to not infer URAM in the
  design, but is not a recommended value.

  -max_dsp <arg> - (Optional) Specify the maximum number of DSPs to add to
  the design during synthesis. Specify a value >= 1, which should not exceed
  the available DSP count on the target device. If a value of -1 is used, the
  Vivado synthesis tool will not exceed the available limit of the device.
  The default value is -1.

  Note: A value of 0 directs Vivado synthesis to not infer DSPs in the
  design, but is not a recommended value.

  -max_bram_cascade_height <arg> - (Optional) Controls the maximum number of
  Block RAM that can be cascaded by the tool. A value of -1 lets Vivado
  synthesis choose up to the maximum number allowed for the target part. The
  default value is -1.

  -max_uram_cascade_height <arg> - (Optional) Controls the maximum number of
  URAM that can be cascaded by the tool. A value of -1 lets Vivado synthesis
  choose up to the maximum number allowed for the target part. The default
  value is -1.

  -retiming - (Optional) For non-Versal devices who do not have retiming
  turned On by default. Seeks to improve circuit performance for intra-clock
  sequential paths by automatically moving registers (register balancing)
  across combinatorial gates or LUTs. It maintains the original behavior and
  latency of the circuit and does not require changes to the RTL sources.

  Note: If both -retiming and -no_retiming are set, retiming will not occur.

  -no_retiming - (Optional). This is for Versal devices where retiming is On
  by default. Turns off the retiming feature.

  Note: If both -retiming and -no_retiming are set, retiming will not occur.

  -no_srlextract - (Optional) Prevents the extraction of shift registers so
  that they get implemented as simple registers.

  -assert - (Optional) Enable VHDL assert statements to be evaluated. A
  severity level of failure stops the synthesis flow and produce an error.

  -no_timing_driven - (Optional) Disables the default timing driven synthesis
  algorithm. This results in a reduced synthesis runtime, but ignores the
  effect of timing on synthesis.

  -debug_log - (Optional) Prints an extended log file that is useful for
  debugging. Will have extra information about logic that was trimmed along
  with sections on the sizes of the RTL partitions and RTL Components. In
  addition, there will be more INFO/WARNING messages that are often ignored.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following example uses the set_property command to define the target
  part for the active project, then elaborates the source files and opens an
  RTL design:

    set_property part xc7vx485tffg1158-1 [current_project]
    synth_design -rtl -name rtl_1

  Note: The default source set, constraint set, and part will be used in this
  example.

  The following example uses the find_top command to define the top of the
  current design for synthesis:

    synth_design -top [lindex [find_top] 0]

  Note: Since find_top returns multiple possible candidates, choosing index 0
  chooses the best top candidate for synthesis.

  The following example runs synthesis on the current design, defining the
  top module and the target part, and specifying no flattening of the
  hierarchy. The results of the synthesis run are then opened in a netlist
  design:

    synth_design -top top -part xc7k70tfbg676-2 -flatten_hierarchy none
    open_run synth_1 -name netlist_1
