## Assignment Specific Responses
  1. How many state machines were inferred for your ADXL362 controller? (review the synthesis report)
  2. Complete the RTL Components table listed [below](#rtl-components-table)
  3. Fill in the Resource Utilization table listed [below](#resource-utilization-table)


### RTL Components Table

Complete the following table by reviewing the synthesis report for your design.
For the '#' column, indicate the number of components of that type that were inferred for your design.
For the 'Total Bits' column, indicate the total number of bits used by that component type (i.e., add up all of the bits used by all components of the given type)

| Resource | # | Total Bits |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Adders   |  |  |
| Registers   |  |  |
| Muxese   |  |  |
 
### Resource Utilization Table

| Resource | Utilization |
| ---- | ---- |
| BUFG   |  |
| CARRY4 |  |
| LUTx   |  |
| FDRE   |  |
| IBUF   |  |
| OBUF   |  |

(For LUTx, add up the total number of LUTs of all sizes)
