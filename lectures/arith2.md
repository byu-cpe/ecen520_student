## Digital Arithmetic #2


## Reading

* Cummings Verilog/SV “Gotchas” paper (See 2006-snug-boston_standard_gotchas_paper.pdf in learning suite)
  * 4.1 - 4.4
  * 5.1 - 5.3

## Key Concepts

  * Verilog 95 artihmetic rules
  * Signed artihmetic rules in Verilog 2001 (i.e., when is the result signed or unsigned)
  * The syntax and meaning of signed literals in Verilog 2001 (what happens when there are fewer or more bits)
  * Rules for arithmetic: mismatched types, incomplete size, sign extension, etc.
