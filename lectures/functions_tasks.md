# Functions, Tasks, and Threads

**Key Concepts**
  * Verilog functions and tasks
    * Syntax of each
    * Difference between them (when to use one over the other)
    * How they are used in a testbench
  * Use of `fork/join` to create multiple threads
  * Examples of using threads for testbenches
  * Generate statements: purpose, syntax, and examples

<!--
This lecture was a bit thin. Consider adding more content and exmaples of testbenches that use functions/tasks
  (maybe a model exmaple?)
I added a discussion on generate statements. Need to give them reading on this.
