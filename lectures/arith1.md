## Digital Arithmetic #1

Binary arithmetic is an essential component of almost every digital system.
Performing binary arithmetic in HDL involves a number of subtleties that must be addressed to operate correctly.
This lecture summarizes the basics of creating proper digital arithmetic HDL using Verilog 2001 (and thus SystemVerilog).
