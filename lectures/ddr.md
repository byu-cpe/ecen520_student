# DDR Memory Interfacing

DRAM is used in most digital systems today.
This lecture reviews how a DRAM functions and the key concepts needed to interface a DRAM device to a digital system.

**Key Concepts**

  * Be able to interpret Figure 5 of the data sheet (i.e., how a dram is organized)
  * Difference between banks, rows, and columns
  * Purpose of all signals on the device
  * DRAM commands: Activate, precharge, refresh, read, write (when and how each command is needed)
  * How to perform single reads or burst reads with the dram
  * How to perform single writes or bursts of writes with the dram
