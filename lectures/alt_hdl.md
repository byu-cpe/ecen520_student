# Alternative HDLs

There are many higher level approaches for digital design than with HDLs.
This lecture provides a brief survey of several different higher level approaches.
In all of these approaches, HDL is generated by the higher level language or framework.

**Key Concepts**

  * What is HLS and what type of input does it require
  * What type of HDL code segments to higher level HDLs need to generate?
  * Know what languages are used as input for Chisel, SpinalHDL, MiGen, and MyHDL
